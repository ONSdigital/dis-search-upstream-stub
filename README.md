# dis-search-upstream-stub

Fake upstream search stub to mimic upstream services using a generic search contract to integrate with our search stack

## Getting started

* Run `make debug` to run application on http://localhost:29600
* Run `make help` to see full list of make targets

### Dependencies

* golang 1.23.x
* No further dependencies other than those defined in `go.mod`

To run `make validate-specification` you require Node v20.x and to install @redocly/cli:

```sh
   npm install -g @redocly/cli
```

### Note:
The `type` parameter in the resource API is optional for the upstream service and is intended for internal team use. It allows specifying the resource type as either "old" - `content-updated` or "new" - `search-content-updated` By default, it returns "new" if not specified.
